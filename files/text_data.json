    "this pdf contains 24 detailed drawings of miscellaneous parts, to be used for\npractice with autodesk inventor (or any 3d cad package for that matter). some\nof the parts are a bit more challenging than others, but none of them are meant\nto be difficult. however, some are intended for specific modeling tools, and hints\nhave been provided in those cases.\nin the event that you find a missing dimension or two, please accept my apologies in advance, but\ndon\u2019t let it stop you from modeling the part. instead, you can consider this an opportunity to exercise\n\u201cdesigner\u2019s choice\u201d and provide a dimension according to your liking, as there are no right or wrong\nanswers for these practice files.\nas you work your way through these, keep in mind the best practice of creating simple sketches,\nto build well constructed features, which add up to a more complex part.\nbest of luck to you in all of your inventor and design pursuits,",
