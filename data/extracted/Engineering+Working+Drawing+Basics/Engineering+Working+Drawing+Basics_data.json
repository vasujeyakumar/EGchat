Engineering graphics is used in the design process for\nvisualization, communication, and documentation.\nGraphics is a visual communications language that include images, text, and\nnumeric information. Graphics communications using engineering drawings and\nmodels is a clear and precise language with definite rules that must be mastered in\norder to be successful in engineering design. Graphics communications are used in\nevery phase of engineering design starting from concept illustration all the way to\nthe manufacturing phase.\n\uf0b7 An engineering (or technical) drawing is a graphical representation of a part,\nassembly, system, or structure and it can be produced using freehand,\nmechanical tools, or computer methods.\n\uf0b7 Working drawings are the set of technical drawings used during the\nmanufacturing phase of a product. They contain all the information needed to\nmanufacture and assemble a product.\nCodes and Standards\nCodes and standards are made to organize and unify the engineering work.\nImagine; what if there was no standard for bolts?\n\uf0b7 A code is a set of specifications for the analysis, design, manufacture, and\nconstruction of something.\n\uf0b7 A standard is a set of specifications for parts, materials, or processes intended\nto achieve uniformity, efficiency and specific quality.\nExamples of the organizations that establish standards and design codes: ISO , AISI,\nSAE, ASTM, ASME, ANSI, DIN.\nThere are many different standards related to technical drawings.\nThe ISO standards for technical drawings are found in a two volumes handbook:\n\uf0b7 ISO Standards Handbook: Technical drawings, Volume 1: Technical drawings\nin general\n\uf0b7 ISO Standards Handbook: Technical drawings, Volume 2: Mechanical\nengineering drawings; Construction drawings; Drawing equipment\nMENG 204 - Mechanical Drawing Lecture Notes by: Dr. Ala Hijazi\nEngineering Working Drawings Basics Page 1 of 22",

Axonometric views are classified according to how the axes\nare oriented into Isometric, Diametric and Trimetric.\n\uf0b7 Isometric View In isometric views the two\nedges of the view make 30\u2070 angles with the\nhorizontal and that makes the three angles\nbetween the view axes to be equal to 120\u2070.\n\uf0b7 Diametric View In diametric views the\nangles may vary but two of the three\nangles between the view axes are equal.\n\uf0b7 Trimetric View In trimetric views all three angles\nbetween view axes are different.\nOblique Views\nThe front face of an oblique view is drawn to the exact\nshape and size while the other two faces are projected\nfrom this front face at any convenient angle (usually 45\u2070)\nand in any direction.

Therefore, any surface that is not in line with the\nthree major axis needs its own projection plane to show the features correctly.\nDetail Views\nA detail view is a separate large-scale drawing view\nof a small section of another view. It is usually used\nto show features that are small relative to the size of\nthe part or assembly being depicted by the drawing.\nA detail view is designated by a letter and its scale is\nindicated.\nBroken Views\nBroken views are usually used for parts having one of its dimensions significantly\nlarger than the other dimension (such as long shafts) in order to make it possible to\ndisplay the drawing view in a larger scale on a\nsmaller size drawing sheet. In a broken view,\nportions of the view that do not contain any\ndetails are broken out (removed) and the\nremaining portions of the view are brought\ncloser together.\nDimensioning\nDimensioning is the process of defining the size, form and location of geometric\nfeatures and components on an engineering drawing.\nBefore an object can be built, complete information about both the size and shape\nof the object must be available. The exact shape of the part or assembly is shown by\nthe different views in the drawing sheet. Dimensions are added to the two-\ndimensional views (not to the 3D view) in the drawing sheet such that it will show all\nthe size and location details of the part.\n\uf0b7 In metric drawings, generally, dimensions are in millimeters. To avoid having to\nspecify 'mm' after every dimension, a label such as 'all dimensions in mm' or\n'unless otherwise stated all dimensions are in mm' is usually contained in the\ntitle block.\n\uf0b7 If the dimension is less than one a leading zero should be used before the\ndecimal point (e.g., 0.5).\n\uf0b7 Dimensions used in drawings can be categorized as:\nMENG 204 - Mechanical Drawing Lecture Notes by: Dr. Ala Hijazi\nEngineering Working Drawings Basics Page 8 of 22",

They are\ngenerally drawn up to 1 mm from the outline of\nthe object.\nDimension lines are used to label a particular\ndimension. They have one or more arrowheads.\n\uf0b7 Dimensions are usually placed between extension lines. But when there is no\nenough room to accommodate the dimension, either the dimension value or the\ndimension lines can be located the outside extension lines as illustrated.\nTypes of Dimensions\nDimensions may be divided into three different types; Linear dimensions, Angular\ndimensions, and Leader dimensions.\n\uf0b7 Linear Dimensions - they are either horizontal or vertical to the dimensioning\nplane.\n\uf0b7 Angular Dimensions - they are usually specified in decimal degrees (e.g.,\n27.5\u00b0). Also they can be specified using degrees and minutes or degrees\nminutes and seconds (e.g., 27\u00b030' or 0\u00b015'40\" ).\n\uf0b7 Leader Dimensions - they are usually used to specify a diameter or a radius\nwhere a leader line is used to point towards the feature being dimensioned.\nMENG 204 - Mechanical Drawing Lecture Notes by: Dr. Ala Hijazi\nEngineering Working Drawings Basics Page 9 of 22",

Aligned\ndimensions should always be readable from the bottom or the right of the\ndrawing.\nChain Dimensioning and Baseline Dimensioning\nChain Dimensioning (dimensioning from feature to feature) is commonly used and\neasy to insert. Chains of dimension should only be used if the function of the object\nwon't be affected by the accumulation of the tolerances.\nMENG 204 - Mechanical Drawing Lecture Notes by: Dr. Ala Hijazi\nEngineering Working Drawings Basics Page 10 of 22",

Sometimes\nthe object manufacturing requires both metric and US measuring system and in\nsuch case dual dimensioning may be necessary. The optional secondary units are\nnormally displayed in brackets [ ].\nDimensioning Rules\nSome of the most important rules for dimensioning are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Dimension figures should never be crowded or in any way that make them\ndifficult to read.\n\uf0b7 Each feature should be dimensioned.\n\uf0b7 Dimensions should be placed outside the part when possible.\n\uf0b7 Dimensions should be evenly spaced and grouped.\n\uf0b7 Dimensions should not be duplicated or the same information given in two\ndifferent ways (except when dual dimensioning is to be used) and no\ndimensions should be given except those needed to produce or inspect the\npart.\n\uf0b7 Dimensions should be placed in the views where the features being\ndimensioned are shown in true shape.\n\uf0b7 Dimensioning to hidden lines should be avoided wherever possible (section\nviews may be used to show the shape and dimensions of internal features).\nMENG 204 - Mechanical Drawing Lecture Notes by: Dr. Ala Hijazi\nEngineering Working Drawings Basics Page 12 of 22",

A center line, not an object\nline, is used to separate the sectioned\nhalf from the unsectioned half of the\nview. Half section views are most often\nused on parts that are symmetrical, such\nas cylinders.\nBroken-out Section\nA broken-out section is used to show interior\nfeatures of a part by breaking away some of\nthe object. A broken-out section is used\ninstead of a half or full section view to save\ntime. A break line separates the sectioned\nfrom un-sectioned portion of the view. A\njagged break line is drawn to represent the\nedge of the break. No cutting plane line is\ndrawn for the broken-out section view. Unlike\nhalf sections, hidden lines are shown in the un-\nsectioned portion of the view.\nRevolved Section\nA revolved section is made by revolving the cross-section view of the part about an\naxis of rotation placed at the location of the cutting plane. The cross-section created\nat the position that the cutting\nplane passed is revolved 90\ndegrees and drawn on the view.\nVisible lines adjacent to the\nrevolved view can either be\ndrawn or broken out using\nconventional breaks.
